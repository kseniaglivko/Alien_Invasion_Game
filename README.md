#Alien Invasion PC Game

This is a realisation of Space Invaders Project from Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition, with some improvements.

Instructions:

- P or Press Play Button to start game.
- Right arrow, left arrow to move the ship.
- Space to fire a bullet (three bullets are allowed on the screen at the same time).
- Right Shift to fire a superbullet (one superbullet allowed on the screen).
- Left Shift or Press mute/unmute buttons to turn the sound on and off.
- Q or ESC to quit.

Features, added to the original project:

1. Randomly generated starry sky as background.
2. Added one superbullet* that can stay active even after destroing an alien. 
3. Explosion animation; scale of explosion depends on bullet/collision type.
4. Sound effects.
5. Mute and unmute buttons.

*Amount of points, given for destroying an alien with a superbullet, is half as much as for destroying an alien with a simple bullet, due to its increased power.
